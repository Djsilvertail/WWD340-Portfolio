    <h1><a href="../index.html">Week Four Questions</a></h1>
    <p>This week I struggled a little bit with making sure I understood the concepts. I made sure to reach out to my team
        and I also made sure to reach out to a friend that does webdesign for a living. I did the coding, I just used him as a guide and 
        encyclopidia.
