    <h2>Chapter 8 Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.</li>

        <li>Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.</li>

        <li>HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.</li>

        <li>document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.</li>

        <li>form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.</li>

        <li>Forms have focus, blur, and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.</li>

        <li>Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before itâ€™s been submitted.</li>

        <li>The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.
        </li>

        <li>The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a
            custom validation script may be required.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 12 Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own
            properties and methods.</li>

        <li>The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.</li>

        <li>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.</li>

        <li>ES6 introduced class declarations that use the class keyword. These can be used in place of constructor
            functions.</li>

        <li>Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keyword this refers to the object returned by the
            function.</li>

        <li>All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype.
        </li>

        <li>The prototype is live, so new properties and methods can be added to existing instances.</li>

        <li>The prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object lacks a method, JavaScript will check
            whether its prototype has the method. If not, it will check that functions prototype until it finds the
            method or reaches the Object constructor function.</li>

        <li>Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables using const and defining a function
            inside a constructor function. These can be made public using getter and setter functions.</li>

        <li>Monkey-patching is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes. This
            should be done with caution as it can cause unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work</li>

        <li>A mixin method can be used to add properties and methods from other objects without creating an inheritance
            chain.</li>

        <li>Methods can be chained together and called in sequence if they return a reference to this.</li>

        <li>Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>

        <li>>The value of this is not retained inside nested functions, which can cause errors. This can be worked
            around by using that = this, using the bind(this) method and using arrow functions.</li>

        <li>Methods can be borrowed from other objects.</li>

        <li>Composition over inheritance is a design pattern where objects are composed from 'building-block' objects,
            rather than inheriting all their properties and methods from a parent class.</li>
    </ul>
