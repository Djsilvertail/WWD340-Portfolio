      <h1><a href="../index.html">Week Five Questions</a></h1>>
      <p>This week google was my friend. I really struggled to understand the team assignment and even going over it with my team still 
        didn't seem to help. I rectified my issues my taking some advice from a friend and sat down and googled everything I could to understand
        what was going on and how to create a working app. I was finally able to accomplish this, YAY!
