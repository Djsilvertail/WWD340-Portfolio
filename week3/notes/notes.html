  <h1><a href="../index.html">Week Three Notes</a></h1>
  <h2>Chapter 5 Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Objects are a collection of key-value pairs placed inside curly braces {}.</li>

    <li>Objects have properties that can be any JavaScript value. If its a function, its known as a method.</li>

    <li>An objects properties and methods can be accessed using either dot notation or square bracket notation.</li>

    <li>Objects are mutable, which means their properties and methods can be changed or removed.</li>

    <li>Objects can be used as parameters to functions, which allows arguments to be entered in any order, or omitted.
    </li>

    <li>Nested objects can be created by placing objects inside objects.</li>

    <li>JSON is a portable data format that uses JavaScript object literals to exchange information.</li>

    <li>The Math object gives access to a number of mathematical constants.</li>

    <li>The Math object can be used to perform mathematical calculations.</li>

    <li>The Date object can be used to create date objects.</li>

    <li>Once you have created a Date object, you can use the getter methods to access information about that date.</li>

    <li>Once you have created a Date object, setter methods can be used to change information about that date.</li>

    <li>The Regex object can be used to create regular expressions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Objects are an interesting entity. I am still trying to wrap my head around all the information in this chapter and have
    ventured off on my own to learn more. I regularly use sites like Codecademy to enhance my learning. </p>
  <h2>Chapter 6 Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Document Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes.</li>

    <li>The document.getElementById(), document.getElementsByClassName(), document.getElementsByTagNames() and
      document.querySelector() can be used to access elements on a page.</li>

    <li>The parentNode(), previousSibling(), nextSibling(), childNodes() and children() methods can be used to navigate
      around the DOM tree.</li>

    <li>An elements attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute() method, and updated using the setAttribute()
      method.</li>

    <li>The createElement() and createTextNode() methods can be used to create dynamic markup on the fly.</li>

    <li>>Markup can be added to the page using the appendChild() and insertBefore() methods.</li>

    <li>Elements can be replaced using the replaceChild() method, and removed using the removeChild() method.</li>

    <li>The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM.</li>

    <li>The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style property.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This chapter I learned a lot about the Document Object Model. I didn't realize just how many different ways there is
    to access different elements. I tried to learn the DOM tree and did some practice on my own. I will continue to practice
    and see what I can do to improve my knowledge.
  </p>
  <h2>Chapter 7 Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.</li>

    <li>An event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs.</li>

    <li>The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties and methods
      relating to the event.</li>

    <li>There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events.</li>

    <li>You can remove an event using the removeEventListener method.</li>

    <li>The default behavior of elements can be prevented using the preventDefault() function.</li>

    <li>Event propagation is the order the events fire on each element.</li>

    <li>Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to capture events that happen to its
      children elements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This chapter was a bit of a review from all my practicing.</p>
