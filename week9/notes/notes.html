    <h2>Chapter 09 Summary</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>The window object is the global object in a browser.</li>

        <li>Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.</li>

        <li>alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the
            execution of the program.</li>

        <li>The window.navigator object gives information about the users browser and operating system, although it can
            be unreliable.</li>

        <li> The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.</li>

        <li> The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</li>

        <li> You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesnt mean you should!).</li>

        <li>The window.screen object provides information about the users screen.</li>

        <li> document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.</li>

        <li> Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie
            property.</li>

        <li> The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be
            canceled using the clearTimeout() method.</li>

        <li>The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the
            clearInterval() method.</li>

        <li> The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by
            utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame()
            method.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Chapter 14 Summary</h2>

    <ul>

        <li> HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies,
            including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.</li>

        <li> data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user
            experience with JavaScript.</li>

        <li> The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the users device in a similar way to cookies,
            but without the same storage restrictions.</li>

        <li> The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the users device, as long as the
            user gives permission.</li>

        <li> The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to
            avoid websites becoming unresponsive.</li>

        <li> Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way
            communication.</li>

        <li> The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.</li>

        <li> The <audio> and <video> elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They
                    also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.</li>

        <li> The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in
            real-time using JavaScript.</li>

        <li> A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.</li>

    </ul>
