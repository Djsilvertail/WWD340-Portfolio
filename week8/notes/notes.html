    <h2><a href="../index.html">Week 08 Notes</a></h2>
    <p>This week I realized I don't like flashy, animations and banners. I do like my websites to look nice but I find a lot
        of the animations and banners are over used and it starts to look tacky. Maybe I am more of a traditionalist than I like to admit
        but plain and simple seem to look the best to me. Having said that I still think color, and borders and having information
        organized and aligned is very important but all the extra flashy stuff just isn't for me.
