    <h2><a href="../index.html">Week 08 Questions</a></h2>
    <p>Again I spent what free time I gave myself learning and practicing on my own. I have bought myself a year subscription at Codecademy and
        have been enjoying working through the full stack course. I love how they set up their examples and give me a chance to practice what I am
        learning. W3Schools is another website I often go to to supplement my learning.
